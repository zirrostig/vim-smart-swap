Intelligently handles VIM's swap files on startup, intercepting the swap file
detected dialog if the swap file is identical or older than the file being
opened. 

                                                        *smartswap-purpose*
The primary purpose of this plugin is to make it so the swap file
detected dialog actually means the swap file probably has unsaved work in it.
Whereas before, I almost always just deleted the swap without thinking about
it, which has resulted in the occasional loss of work.

                                                        *smartswap-explain*
Smartswap checks two properties of the swap file and if either properties
passes, tells VIM to remove the swap file. When it does this, the dialog
prompting the user is never shown. 

The first thing checked is timestamps, assuming the default of enabled, if the
swap file has an older time stamp than the file being opened it is deleted.

Next assuming the time stamp check failed and that diff check is not disabled,
a diff of the files is done, and if they are identical, the swap is deleted.

If both of these cases fail the use will then, and only then see the swap file
detected dialog, knowing that the swap is newer and/or differs from the file
being opened, and that they should probably inspect the swap for lost work.

                                            the swap file if they are
                                            identical.
